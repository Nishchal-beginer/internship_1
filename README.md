Today we learn about what is sql and how we use it to create databases ,
First I create the database in Mysql tool  after that i create tables and add data in the table using import table option
After that i use the same excel sheet for dataset , from which i extract data 
And then i create the new excel sheet and then i  convert the excel sheet in csv file,
csv file can easily export the data into the tables .
After that i learn about entities and relations . 

For EER Diagram i use pizza_sales dataset and try to create a EER Diagram and shows the relations betweeen them directly from dataset
